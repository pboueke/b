## Hello There
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems every so often I completely redesign my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) page. This time it took more time than the usual, and I am not sure about the result. I suppose it's better than before, but that is not saying much.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that the simplicity and convenience of the GitHub and Jekyll integration keeps attracting me towards it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the freedom, lightweightness and ease of use that this combination offers. Just keep in mind the limitations imposed by [GitHub's restrictive gem dependencies](https://pages.github.com/versions/) and save yourself a few hours. Seriously.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully, there will also be working comment threads using the DISQUS integration by the end of the week. Hopefully.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, btw, that awesome thing with the moving polygons, which inspired me to do all this, was made  by [this guy](https://codepen.io/shakdaniel/) in this awesome pen:
