## What is it?

See for yourself: [PONGO](http://pboueke.github.io/CG0X/#)

(you must be using a modern browser)

It's a simple 3D pong game, still missing some pieces. It's made with the [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) framework and some other bits.

## Why?

This was a project for the Computer Graphics course at UFRJ. And was really fun to make.

## Features

* Versus (against AI or yourself) an Squash game modes;
* AI with multiple levels of difficulty;
* 2 (functional) ball types;
* Simple controls;
* Useless options menu;
* Funny bugs;
* Not so funny bugs;

<small>*Ohh.. and you better keep it at 60 FPS*</small>

## Code

I might update it... someday.
